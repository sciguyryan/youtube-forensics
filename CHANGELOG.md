## 2.0.0

- Initial full release.

## 2.0.0-rc9

- Added explicit operator identity resolution with precedence: command line, environment, toolkit configuration, then system username fallback.
- Added `init` to store a persistent default operator in `ROOT/config.json` with mode `0600`.
- Added a prominent warning whenever the toolkit must fall back to the current login username.
- Added `operator_source` and `operator_username` to case records, and mirrored runtime identity and hostname in `TOOLKIT.json`.
- Added operator identity to the acquisition log, acquisition summary, and `acquisition.txt`.
- Added regression tests for precedence, fallback, configuration permissions, and CLI parsing.

## 2.0.0-rc7

- Fixed acquisition logging so primary yt-dlp, live-chat, and supplemental curl command output is appended to the main acquisition log.
- Main command transcripts now record the invoked command, stdout, stderr, and exit status with UTC timestamps.
- Retained exact unmodified command output in the existing dedicated report files.
- Added finalization-stage log messages and regression tests for transcript capture.

# Changelog

## 2.0.0-rc3

- Made direct `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m youtube_forensic` execution the primary first-run path.
- Added separate activation instructions for Bash/Zsh and fish.
- Documented the fish `activate.fish` requirement.
- Added distro-specific guidance for installing `venv` and `pip`.
- Clarified that runtime execution has no third-party Python package dependencies.

# Changelog

## 2.0.0-rc2 - 2026-07-19

- Removed the ambiguous extensionless source-tree shell launcher.
- Retained the standard `pyproject.toml` console entry point, which installs `youtube-forensic`.
- Documented explicit source-tree execution with `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m youtube_forensic`.
- Added copy/paste acquisition and verification examples using case `CASE-0031`.

## 2.0.0-rc1 - 2026-07-19

- Reimplemented toolkit orchestration and verification in Python 3.11+.
- Added mandatory case comments and optional matter title/requestor fields.
- Added generated canonical `CASE_RECORD.json` and human-readable `CASE_RECORD.md`.
- Added `TOOLKIT.json` with Python, platform, and external-tool versions.
- Added explicit transactional finalization and isolated mandatory verification.
- Added a canonical acquired-payload manifest, `EVIDENCESET-SHA256.txt`.
- Categorically excluded transient `INCOMPLETE` state from inventories and manifests.
- Retained dedicated passphrase-protected RSA-4096 GPG signing keys.
- Retained best-effort, separately reported live-chat acquisition.
- Added automated tests for transient-state exclusion, Unicode paths, case records, CLI requirements, and archive path safety.

## 2.0.0-rc5

- Verification summaries now size the label column dynamically so every detail value remains aligned, including long document names.
- Added a regression test for summary-column alignment.

## 2.0.0-rc4

- Prepare and validate the dedicated GnuPG environment before first-run key generation.
- Detect a controlling terminal and configure an available pinentry helper automatically.
- Reload and launch `gpg-agent`, then require a reported agent socket before invoking key generation.
- Preserve existing evidence keys without requiring pinentry during the inspection phase.
- Improve actionable errors for missing terminal, pinentry, agent, or socket initialization.
- Document public-key export, protected secret-key backup, ownertrust export, and restoration into a fresh dedicated keyring.

## 2.0.0-rc9

- Added interactive `init` wizard for name, stable ID, organisation, role, public contact, and system-keyring signing-key selection.
- Added full primary/signing-subkey fingerprint validation and optional test signing.
- Added active-profile digest pinning in `config.json` and per-acquisition `--identity-file` override.
- Added operator identity/public-key snapshots and mandatory personal detached archive signatures.
- Extended verification to validate the operator signature and exact signing fingerprint.
